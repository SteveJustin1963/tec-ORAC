- "The First name for the Z-80 computer prototype...was not actually called a TEC-1, and was unlike to be any that are shown in the photos. It was casually refered to as Orac...and it has not survived. It was built by John Hardy"
- now to recreate a real ORAC based on Blakes 7 lore

1. Access other computers data and or remote control them 
2. The signals are sent over WIFI
3. It has an AI personality that learns from its users and has a curiosity about the universe. Start with tensor-flow code to classify images
4. Can simulate or decode different signals
5. The ability to predict a probability outcomes give input parameters Take a 10 word question and predict a probability outcome between 0% to 100% 
6. Has protection software agains hacking, intrusion and viruses
