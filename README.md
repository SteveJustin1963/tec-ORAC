# A WTF tec project .... + is that a question? +

"The First name for the Z-80 computer prototype...was not actually called a TEC-1, and was unlike to be any that are shown in the photos. It was casually referred to as Orac...and it has not survived. It was built by John Hardy". Now to recreate a real ORAC based on Blakes 7 lore, batteries not included but source code is !

### Features in software
Orac is an AI computer and its abilities are listed as: 
1. Access other computers data and or remote control them 
2. The signals are sent over WIFI
3. It has an AI personality that learns from its users and has a curiosity about the universe. Start with tensor-flow code to classify images
4. Can simulate or decode different signals
5. The ability to predict a probability outcomes give input parameters Take a 10 word question and predict a probability outcome between 0% to 100% 
6. Has protection software against hacking, intrusion and viruses 

### Features in hardware
[3dw]; "This is a 3d build of Orac, a computer character from the classic BBC television series Blake's 7 that aired from 1978 to 1981. Orac was a portable supercomputer that appeared as a transparent box filled with tube-like electronic parts surrounding a sphere of flashing lights. The unit buzzed like an insect when turned on by a removable key on the top of the box. Orac's personality was much like its creator, a brilliant, but stubborn old man named Ensor, who at age 18, revolutionized the galactic computer industry with the invention of the tarial cell. Orac could remotely access and control any computer that used tarial cell technology, thus it was extremely valuable and gave Blake and his companions an edge over their enemy, the totalitarian Federation. #BBC #Blakes #computer #Orac #scifi #Seven #television".



### build
- transparent box, 3.5mm perspex or polycarbonate
- sphere inside as a light ball, hinting at optical tank circuit for neural activity see https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-BRAIN

### code 
- orac.c ; full of errors obviously, run SDCC for the z80 to get asm code
- forth code coming
- MINT code coming
