# A WTF tec project .... + is that a question? +

"The First name for the Z-80 computer prototype...was not actually called a TEC-1, and was unlike to be any that are shown in the photos. It was casually referred to as Orac...and it has not survived. It was built by John Hardy". Now to recreate a real ORAC based on Blakes 7 lore, batteries not included but source code is !

## Features in software
Orac is an AI computer and its abilities are listed as: 
1. Access other computers data and or remote control them; This feature is technically feasible as it can be implemented with existing technologies such as remote access software and network protocols.
2. Communication over WiFi: This feature is also technically feasible as WiFi technology is widely available and commonly used for wireless communication.
3. It has an AI personality that learns from its users and has a curiosity about the universe. Start with tensor-flow code to classify images; AI personality that learns from users and has a curiosity about the universe: This feature is technically feasible as AI and machine learning techniques are widely used in various applications, and with the use of Tensorflow it could be used to classify sound and images.
4. The ability to simulate or decode various signals is a feature that is technically feasible as it can be achieved through the use of signal processing and machine learning techniques, which are commonly used in various applications. Signal processing is a method of analyzing, modifying, and synthesizing signals such as sound, images, and other data. It involves using mathematical algorithms to extract information from a signal, such as detecting patterns or removing noise. Signal processing techniques are used in a wide range of applications, including telecommunications, audio and image processing, control systems, and biomedical signal processing.
Machine learning, on the other hand, is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves using algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning techniques can be used to analyze and interpret complex data, such as images, text, and audio.
Combining these two techniques can be used to simulate or decode different signals, such as audio or video signals, and extract useful information from them. For example, in audio processing, signal processing techniques can be used to filter out noise and improve the quality of the sound, while machine learning techniques can be used to classify the audio and recognize speech. In video processing, signal processing can be used to remove noise and improve the quality of the video, while machine learning can be used to classify the video and detect objects.
5. The ability to predict probability outcomes based on input parameters, such as a 10 word question, is technically feasible. This feature can be achieved through the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, which can be used to analyze input data and make predictions. AI and ML algorithms can be trained on a set of data and can then use that information to calculate the probability of a certain outcome, such as the likelihood of a particular event occurring or the probability of a certain outcome resulting from a given input. These predictions can range from 0% to 100%. 
6.The feature of having protection software against hacking, intrusion and viruses is technically feasible as there are a variety of security software and protocols that can be implemented to safeguard against these types of attacks. These include firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and encryption protocols that can be used to secure networks and protect against unauthorized access. Additionally, implementing best practices such as updating software and keeping systems patched can also help to prevent hacking and intrusion attempts.

## Features in hardware
- Portable supercomputer resembling a transparent box with tube-like electronic parts and a sphere of flashing lights.
- Emits a buzzing sound when turned on with a removable key located on the top of the box.
- AI personality that is similar to its creator, Ensor, a brilliant but stubborn old man.
- Revolutionized the galactic computer industry with the invention of the tarial cell.
- Ability to remotely access and control any computer that utilizes tarial cell technology.
- Extremely valuable resource for Blake and his companions in their fight against the totalitarian Federation.
- From the classic BBC television series Blake's 7 that aired from 1978 to 1981.



### To build the 3D representation of Orac, 
the following materials and steps can be used:
- Use a 3.5mm thick transparent material such as perspex or polycarbonate for the box.
- Incorporate a sphere inside the box as a light ball, to suggest the use of an optical tank circuit for neural activity, similar to the one found in the tec-BRAIN project on GitHub.
- For a reference design, you can refer to the 3D Warehouse model of Blake's 7 Orac v17, available at the provided link.
