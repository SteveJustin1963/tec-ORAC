# tec-ORAC
- a wtf tech project
- "The First name for the Z-80 computer prototype...was not actually called a TEC-1, and was unlike to be any that are shown in the photos. It was casually refered to as Orac...and it has not survived. It was built by John Hardy"
- now to recreate a real ORAC based on Blake;s 7 lore
- code draft
